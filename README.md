Machine learning project to predict telecom customer churn using feature engineering and model tuning
# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn in the telecom domain using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Identify customers likely to churn
- Apply feature engineering based on domain knowledge
- Compare baseline and tuned models
- Optimize recall for churn customers

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- One-Hot Encoding
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (tuned for recall)

## Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts show higher churn
- High monthly charges increase churn risk

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Future Work
- Add neural network model
- Experiment with threshold tuning
